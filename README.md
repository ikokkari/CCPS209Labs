# CCPS 209 Labs

This repository contains the labs and the automated JUnit test classes for the course [CCPS 209 Computer Science II](https://github.com/ikokkari/JavaExamples), as taught by [Ilkka Kokkarinen](https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~ikokkari/) for the Chang School of Continuing Education, Ryerson University, Toronto. There are currently 95 problems available for students to choose the problems they wish to solve, depending on their inclinations and personal interest. Most of these labs consist of several methods to write. For the grading purposes, every JUnit test class counts as one lab. These problems drive in the techniques of Java and object-oriented programming, and also illustrate some deeper ideas in computer science and mathematics.

The specifications for the lab problems are given in the PDF document [CCPS 209 Labs](https://github.com/ikokkari/CCPS209Labs/blob/master/CCPS%20209%20Labs.pdf).
