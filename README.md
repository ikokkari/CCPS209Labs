# CCPS 209 Labs

This repository contains the labs and the fully automated JUnit test classes for the course [CCPS 209 Computer Science II](https://github.com/ikokkari/JavaExamples), as taught by [Ilkka Kokkarinen](https://www.cs.ryerson.ca/~ikokkari/) for the Chang School of Continuing Education, Toronto Metropolitan University, Canada. There is a total of 99 problems followed by fourteen bonus problems available for students to freely choose the problems they wish to solve, depending on their inclinations and personal interest. Most of these problems consist of several methods to write. For the purposes of grading, every JUnit test class counts as one lab. These problems drive in the techniques of Java and object-oriented programming, and also illustrate some deeper ideas in computer science and mathematics.

The specifications for the lab problems are given in the PDF document [CCPS 209 Labs](https://github.com/ikokkari/CCPS209Labs/blob/master/CCPS%20209%20Labs.pdf).

Problems so far unsolved are given bounties of 100 CAD for the first solver of each such problem, as a donation for a good cause. See the file [bounty.md](https://github.com/ikokkari/CCPS209Labs/blob/main/bounty.md) for the list of bounties both claimed and still open.
